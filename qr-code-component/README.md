## Overview

This project was a frontend challenge where I recreated a card component from a design, focusing on responsive layout, accurate styling, and clean code structure. It helped me practice translating design files into functional, maintainable HTML and CSS.

## My process

I initially jumped straight into coding and quickly felt lost and overwhelmed, especially with each folder containing a README.md file. Taking the time to read them, along with referencing the Figma file and style guidelines, made the process much clearer and more manageable.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I improved my understanding of positioning by using Flexbox instead of relying on padding and margins to center elements, and I applied `min-height: 100vh` to center the card vertically. I learned to reference the Figma file directly instead of just copying from an image, which helped me follow the style guide and use design assets which I haven't done before. While we were working in group I learned by we use CSS properties like `box-sizing: border-box;`, which keeps element dimensions predictable by including padding and borders. I also experimented with HSL vs. hex colors from different style guides, practiced using the hidden attribute, and polished my Markdown writing skills for documentation.

### Continued development

Next, I plan to rebuild this project using frameworks like React and TailwindCSS. I also want to deploy it on Netlify for live testing and later add interactive features. This will help me practice modern frontend workflows and improve my overall development skills.

### Useful resources

Traversy media. CSS cheatsheet. Figma.
